# calfit

Python package to fit calibration solutions obtained from MWA Hyprdrive.

## Matovation
Fitting the solution (amplitudes and phases) had several useful purposes, one of those is to try to reduce noise on the calibration solution, thus attempting to reduce noise on our final data product.

Another useful information is to the goodness of fit which would give a quality assurance metric to identify the spread/variance of the solutions. 

## Installation
Clone the repo using
`git clone https://github.com/Chuneeta/calfit.git \n`
`cd calfit`
`python setup.py install`
